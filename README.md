This Terraform configuration file sets up an S3 bucket, configures versioning and server-side encryption for the bucket, and creates a DynamoDB table for state locking. Here's a summary of the resources and configurations:

The terraform block specifies the required provider for the configuration, in this case, the AWS provider from HashiCorp with a version constraint of "~> 3.0".

The provider "aws" block defines the AWS provider configuration and sets the region to "us-east-1".

The resource "aws_s3_bucket" block defines an S3 bucket resource named "terraform_state" with the bucket name "dev-backend-tf-bucket" and the force_destroy attribute set to true, allowing the bucket to be forcefully destroyed.

The resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" block configures versioning for the S3 bucket. It uses the bucket ID of the previously defined S3 bucket and sets the versioning status to "Enabled".

The resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" block configures server-side encryption for the S3 bucket. It uses the bucket name of the S3 bucket defined earlier and specifies AES256 as the encryption algorithm.

The resource "aws_dynamodb_table" block defines a DynamoDB table resource named "terrafrom_lock" with a billing mode of "PAY_PER_REQUEST". It sets the "LockID" attribute as the hash key for the table.
